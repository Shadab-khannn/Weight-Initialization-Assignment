    "  \\frac{2}{fan_{in}}. This is similar to Xavier initialization, but it uses only the fan-in term to scale the variance. This technique is\n",
    "  suitable for ReLU activation functions, as it prevents them from dying out.\n",
    "- Orthogonal Initialization : This technique assigns random values to the weights from an orthogonal matrix, i.e., a matrix whose columns or\n",
    "  rows are mutually orthogonal. This helps to preserve the norm of the inputs and outputs across layers and avoid exploding or vanishing \n",
    "  gradients.\n",
    "- Sparse Initialization : This technique assigns random values to a fraction of the weights, while setting the rest to zero. This helps to \n",
    "  reduce the number of parameters and avoid overfitting, but it may also cause underfitting or slow convergence."
